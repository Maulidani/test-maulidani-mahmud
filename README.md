# AI-Enhanced Asynchronous Programming

## Objective

Create a Kotlin suspend function `analyzeCustomerFeedback` that takes customer feedback (String) as input and interacts with a simulated AI service to perform sentiment analysis. The function should return a summary (String) of the sentiment analysis. Demonstrate calling this function within a coroutine scope and handling the result.

## Skills Tested

- Deep understanding of Kotlin coroutines and suspend functions.
- Integration of AI (even in a simulated context) for processing data.
- Handling of asynchronous results and error handling.

## Description

This project is a Kotlin application developed in IntelliJ IDEA, focusing on leveraging coroutines for asynchronous programming. The primary objective is to implement a Kotlin suspend function for sentiment analysis of customer feedback using a simulated AI service.

## Features

- Asynchronous programming with Kotlin coroutines.
