Problem 2: AI-Enhanced Asynchronous Programming
Objective:
Create a Kotlin suspend function analyzeCustomerFeedback that takes customer feedback (String) as input and interacts with an AI service (simulated) to perform sentiment analysis. The function should return a summary (String) of the sentiment analysis. Demonstrate calling this function within a coroutine scope and handling the result.
Skills Tested:
Deep understanding of Kotlin coroutines and suspend functions.
Integration of AI (even in a simulated context) for processing data.
Handling of asynchronous results and error handling.
